Already implemented
===================
Genetic algorithm from scratch, utilizing crossover, mutations, threading and 2-opt, hashing, unordered map
 -Handles variable number of max packages (say as a volume amount?)
 -Variable weight
 -Variable shift-time
 -Prioritizing packages

 
2-opt algorithm

Greedy algorithm

Hashing

Unordered maps

Random package generator with normal distribution clusters

Command-line arguments

Route graph output through gnuplot

Doxygen documentation

String to_upper since there appears to be no such standard function

String whitespace trimming as there appears to be no such standard function.

Database integration with SQLite3


Potential future extensions
===========================
Multi-route/truck through polar coordinates and k-mean clustering

Package "aging" giving older packages more priority weight

Delivery windows (too early, need to wait, too late no package "reward")



Concerns
========
-Pieces work
-No crashes
-Readable code
